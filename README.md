# AdvCardSignup

Tool to bulk generate sheets of AdvantEdge card signup forms with pre-registered cards to be stored at registers

## Usage:
- Take a stack of Unregistered Advantedge cards, and pre-register them under the loyalty application
- Input every adv card number in the stack into the box
  - Tip: You can actually scan the card using the SmartCheck scanner
- Print and cut out the forms
- Attach the physical card to the form and store it at the register
- Teammates should push this instead of just using the store card
- If a guest does not have a card, the teammate will ask. If the customer agrees, the teammate should scan and give the guest the actual card, and have them fill out the form. They can either fill out the form right at the register and the cashier can put it in their till, or they can hand it to Guest Services on their way out
